                only.

                But, JavaScript provides the most powerful features that every developer should know to take complete

                What is JavaScript?
                JavaScript has still dominated the WWW (World Wide Web) due to its unique features for building
                client-side interactive web pages. JavaScript is a client-side scripting language used in building web
                pages using HTML and CSS embedded with JavaScript code.

                JavaScript is also simply known as JS.

                Today, JavaScript is the only popular programming language used by millions of web developers for
                client-side scripting. The JavaScript programs are called as scripts which are simply JS code embedded
                in HTML web pages using the script tags.

                JavaScript plays an important role during the development of any web application to make it interactive
                and dynamic.

                What can be achieved using JavaScript?
                Now that We have learned that JavaScript code is embedded into HTML programs and executed at
                client-side.
                When we say JavaScript code executed at client-side, it means web browsers are capable enough to
                understand JavaScript syntax, code and have inbuilt javascript interpreter to execute JS code.

                Nowadays, the vast majority of simple to enterprise level websites and web applications make use of
                javascript code to make them more user-friendly and responding before contacting the web server.

                Important Features of JavaScript Programming Language
                JavaScript has become the most popular web scripting language because of its powerful features that
                allow web developers to create stunning user interfaces (UI) for websites and cloud-based web
                applications. JS follows ECMAScript implementations.

                JS is a scripting language used to manipulate, customize and automate some client-side tasks like – user
                Input/Output operations, input data validation, dynamic HTML generation at runtime and much more. These
                set of features of JavaScript keep it distinct from other scripting languages.

                Here is a list of the most important features of JavaScript:

                JavaScript is Simple – JavaScript is very easy to understand and it is an essential part of front-end
                development.
                JavaScript is Scripting Language – A scripting language doesn’t require a program to be compiled before
                it is executed. JS understands the code on-the-fly by at client side. But, any other programming
                language, requires the program to be compiled to check for syntax errors. In the case of scripting
                language, the code is interpreted as it is loaded in the client end. This helps us to test the results
                of your code more quickly.
                Cross Browser Support – JavaScript has been ported on almost all the web browsers available today in the
                market.
                Perform HTML Form validations – JS allows developers to quickly validate the user input data before it
                is sent to the server. This is a great feature of JavaScript.
                Speed – JS provides an immediate response to users.
                Object-Oriented – JavaScript is Object-Oriented. Object-based means that JavaScript can use items called
                objects. However, the objects are not class based but they are just general objects.
                I/O Support – JS provides a mechanism to handle input/output operations between user and web application
                at client-side ONLY. These features of javascript are used in HTML pages.
                Dynamic HTML and CSS generation – JavaScript can be used to dynamically change contents and styles in
                modern browsers dynamically and instantly in response to user interaction
                Powerful DOM Model – DOM is a collection of HTML Objects organized in the form of a tree structure. The
                Document Object Model (DOM) is created when the website is a first time loaded into the web browser.
                Enables interactive web UI
                Event handling – JS can detect and process the events generated on HTML objects (like Onclick, Hover,
                etc..)
                In-Built Functions – JS has a list of inbuilt function to perform some common tasks like data
                manipulation, math functions, etc.
                Now we have discussed the best features of javascript that web developers can use while developing
                applications.

                NOTE – Using the XMLHttpRequest object allows JavaScript to request data from the server.

                Difference between Client-side scripting and Server-side scripting? Server-Side Languages vs Client-Side
                Languages?
                In simple terms, client-side language runs directly through the client browser being used by the viewer.
                In the case of JavaScript, the client is a Web browser.

                Therefore, JavaScript is run directly in the Web browser and doesn’t require to go through the extra
                step of sending and retrieving information to and from the remote Web server.

                In contrast, A server-side language has to get information from the Web page or the Web browser, send it
                to a program web server which runs on the host’s server, and then sends back the information to the
                browser.

                So, an intermediate step must first send and fetch information from the web server before the
                results of the program are seen in the browser.

                How JavaScript run in the browser?
                No Surprise!

                Have you ever wondered how could JavaScript code execute in the client web browser?

                Yeah!

                JavaScript code is embedded into HTML code. There is the HTML code you can add some special tags or
                commands to inform the browser that this code needs to execute as a script (means JS code). The
                following steps will explain the underlying logic of how JS code executed at the client side:
                1. First of all, JavaScript code is embedded into HTML code.
                2. The client web browser has JS Thread running. This JS thread is responsible to handle everything,
                like scrolling the web page, printing something on the web page, listen to DOM events (like when a user
                clicks a button) and doing other things.
                3. Once browser sees special tags (<script>

                </script>), it understands and interprets the JS commands and executes the code.
                4. Finally, JS create, edit, customize or add HTML/CSS code in your web page.

                Final Words!
                Hope that you have got some points on how powerful is JavaScript with a unique set of features. These
                features of JavaScript make JavaScript most popular among web developers.
