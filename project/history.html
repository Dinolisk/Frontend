            <p> JavaScript was born on the Internet, and came out with the advent of browsers. </p>
            <p> Looking back at its history, we must start with the history of the browser.
                At the end of 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, a scientist at the European Organization for Nuclear Energy
                Research
                (CERN), invented the World Wide Web based on the Internet, the world's largest computer network, and was
                able to
                browse web pages online. The earliest web pages can only be viewed in the terminal of the operating
                system, that
                is to say, only the command line operation can be used, and the web pages are displayed in the character
                window,
                which is of course very inconvenient. </p>
            <p> At the end of 1992, the National Center for Supercomputer Applications (NCSA) began developing a
                standalone
                browser called Mosaic. This is the first browser in human history, from which the web page can be viewed
                in a
                graphical interface window.</p>
            <p> In October 1994, a major NCSA programmer, Marc Andreessen, joined venture capitalist Jim Clark to form
                Mosaic
                Communications, which was later renamed Netscape. The direction of this company is to develop a new
                generation
                of browsers for ordinary users based on Mosaic. Netscape Navigator</p>
            <p>In December 1994, Navigator released version 1.0 with a market share of more than 90%.</p>
            <p>etscape quickly discovered that the Navigator browser needed a scripting language that could be embedded
                in web
                pages to control browser behavior. At that time, the network speed was very slow and the Internet access
                fee was
                very expensive, and some operations should not be completed on the server side. For example, if the user
                forgets
                to fill in the "username", he clicks the "send" button. It is a bit too late to find this on the server.
                It is
                best to tell the user "please fill in the username" before the user sends the data. This requires
                embedding a
                small program in the web page and letting the browser check if each column is filled.</p>
            <p>The management's vision for this browser scripting language is that the functionality does not need to be
                too
                strong, the syntax is simple, and it is easy to learn and deploy. That year, just after Sun's Java
                language came
                out, the marketing campaign was very successful. Netscape decided to work with Sun to support embedded
                Java
                applets (later called Java applets). However, whether the browser scripting language chooses Java is
                controversial. Later, I decided not to use Java because the web applet didn't need the "heavy" syntax of
                Java.
                However, it also determines that the syntax of the scripting language is close to Java and can support
                Java
                programs. These assumptions directly rule out the use of existing languages such as Perl, Python, and
                TCL.</p>
            <p> In 1995, Netscape hired programmer Brendan Eich to develop this web scripting language. Brendan Eich has
                a
                strong background in functional programming and hopes to implement this new language based on the Scheme
                language (a dialect of the LISP language of the functional language).</p>
            <P> In May 1995, Brendan Eich designed the first version of the language in just 10 days. It is a hodgepodge
                with
                multiple sources of grammar.</P>
            <h2 id="development">Development</h2>
            <p> Netscape's browser scripting language, originally called Mocha, changed to LiveScript in September 1995.
                In
                December, Netscape and Sun (the inventor and owner of the Java language) reached an agreement that
                allowed the
                language to be called JavaScript. In this way, Netscape can leverage the power of the Java language, and
                Sun has
                extended its reach to the browser.</p>
            <p>On December 4, 1995, Netscape and Sun jointly released the JavaScript language, which promoted JavaScript
                as a
                supplement to Java. It is a lightweight Java that is designed to operate web pages.</p>
            <p>In March 1996, the Navigator 2.0 browser officially built the JavaScript scripting language.</p>
