                <h2> What Is JavaScript Used For?</h2>
                <br>

                Although JavaScript is usually talked about as a language that is primarily designed for front-end web
                development – and indeed, that’s what I’ve focused on so far – the answer to the question ‘What is
                JavaScript used for?’ isn’t that simple. Along with interactive web elements, a strong knowledge of
                JavaScript will allow you to create the following things:

                <h3>Games</h3>

                If you’re interested in internet gaming and game development, you might consider using your knowledge of
                JavaScript to create your browser-based games. Although limitations are surrounding the complexity of
                browser-based games, JavaScript is as good as any other language when it comes to creating them.

                Building your simple games is also a great way to practice your JavaScript knowledge. Figuring out the
                answers to questions like “What is JavaScript used for?” isn’t always easy, but I think that the best
                way to find out exactly how versatile JavaScript can be is to try things for yourself. Download a code
                editor (I’ll touch on this again later), come up with an idea for a simple game, and put some time into
                building it.

                <h3>Mobile Apps</h3>

                Although most mobile app development is done with operating system specific languages like Swift (iOS)
                or Java (Android), there is no reason why you can’t build apps with JavaScript. The implementation of
                frameworks like Phonegap and React Native have made it possible to create mobile apps for multiple
                operating systems using the same code. JavaScript appears to be a great choice for mobile app
                development in the future.


                <h3>Web & Server Apps</h3>

                Again, the most common answer to the question “What is JavaScript used for?” is something like ‘creating
                interactive web elements’. But this isn’t all. The creation of new libraries and frameworks is allowing
                web developers to build a lot of back-end programs with JavaScript. These include things like web apps
                and server apps. JavaScript is becoming just as essential for back-end web developers as it is for
                front-end developers.

                Note that this is by no means an exhaustive list. JavaScript is a powerful language, and most things
                will only be limited by your imagination.

                <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
                JavaScript ia text-based programming language used both on the client-side and server-side that allows
                you to make web pages interactive. Where HTML and CSS are languages that give structure and style to web
                pages, JavaScript gives web pages interactive elements that engage a user. Common examples of JavaScript
                that you might use every day include the search box on Amazon, a news recap video embedded on The New
                York Times, or refreshing your Twitter feed.

                Incorporating JavaScript improves user experience of the web page by converting it from a static page
                into an interactive one. To recap, JavaScript adds behavior to web pages.



                <h2>What is JavaScript used for?</h2>
                JavaScript is mainly used for web-based applications and web browsers. But JavaScript is also used
                beyond the Web in software, servers and embedded hardware controls. Here are some basic things
                JavaScript is used for:



                <h3>1. Adding interactive behavior to web pages</h3>
                JavaScript allows users to interact with web pages. There are almost no limits to the things you can do
                with JavaScript on a web page – these are just a few examples:

                Show or hide more information with the click of a button

                Change the color of a button when the mouse hovers over it

                Slide through a carousel of images on the homepage

                Zooming in or zooming out on an image

                Displaying a timer or count-down on a website

                Playing audio and video in a web page

                Displaying animations

                Using a drop-down hamburger menu



                <h3>2. Creating web and mobile apps</h3>
                Developers can use various JavaScript frameworks for developing and building web and mobile apps.
                JavaScript frameworks are collections of JavaScript code libraries that provide developers with
                pre-written code to use for routine programming features and tasks—literally a framework to build
                websites or web applications around.

                Popular JavaScript front-end frameworks include React, React Native, Angular, and Vue. Many companies
                use Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment built on Google Chrome’s JavaScript V8 engine. A few
                famous examples include Paypal, LinkedIn, Netflix, and Uber!



                <h3>3. Building web servers and developing server applications</h3>
                Beyond websites and apps, developers can also use JavaScript to build simple web servers and develop the
                back-end infrastructure using Node.js.



                <h3>4. Game development</h3>
                Of course, you can also use JavaScript to create browser games. These are a great way for beginning
                developers to practice their JavaScript skills.



                <h2>Why use JavaScript over other programming languages?</h2>
                Aside from the unlimited possibilities, there are many reasons for web developers to use JavaScript over
                other programming languages:

                JavaScript is the only programming language native to the web browser

                JavaScript is the most popular language

                There’s a low threshold to get started

                It’s a fun language to learn
